The Fibonacci sequence arises from a simple question about rabbits' reproduction.

The problem gives the number of rabbits month after month, in the form: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,...

The Fibonacci sequence arises from a simple question about rabbits' reproduction.

The problem gives the number of rabbits month after month, in the form: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,...
which today we call #Fibonacci #numbers.

The problem gives the number of rabbits month after month, in the form: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,...
which today we call #Fibonacci #numbers.
